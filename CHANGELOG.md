# AI Avatar Platform - Requirements Change Log

All significant requirement changes and their impact on the project architecture are documented here.

## [2025-07-22] - Phase 3 Pivot: Influencer Content Pipeline

### Summary
Major architectural pivot from general content factory and video production pipeline to specialized influencer content harvesting and style-matched generation system.

### Requirements Changes

#### Added Requirements
- **Multi-platform content harvesting**: Automated scraping from TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter
- **AI-powered style analysis**: Computer vision and NLP-based influencer style extraction
- **Style-matched content generation**: Create vlogs, images, videos matching influencer aesthetics
- **Brand consistency engine**: Maintain coherent identity across content formats
- **Social media publishing automation**: Multi-platform posting with optimization
- **Cross-platform coordination**: Synchronized content release strategies

#### Changed Requirements
- **FROM**: Generic video production pipeline with basic script generation
- **TO**: Influencer-specific video generation with style mimicry
- **FROM**: Simple content import via APIs and web crawling  
- **TO**: Specialized social media content harvesting with WebSurfer integration
- **FROM**: Basic multi-platform publishing
- **TO**: Platform-specific optimization with engagement analytics

#### Removed Requirements
- Generic script generation system (replaced with style-aware generation)
- Basic video processing tools (enhanced to style-matching video creation)
- Simple content transformation (upgraded to brand-consistent transformation)

### Impact Analysis

#### Phase 1 Infrastructure (ENHANCED)
**New Requirements Added:**
- WebSurfer tool integration for content scraping capabilities
- Multi-platform API client base classes (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter)
- Content storage and media management system for harvested content
- Enhanced configuration management with social media API credentials
- Avatar personality adaptation framework for influencer style mimicry

**Files Affected:**
- `core/config_manager.py` - Add social media API configuration
- `tools/` - Add WebSurfer integration and platform clients
- `config/social_media.yaml` - New configuration file

#### Phase 2 Avatar Workshop (ENHANCED)
**New Requirements Added:**
- Avatar brand consistency engine for influencer mimicry
- Multi-modal content generation (text, voice, visual style)
- Media processing pipeline for images and videos
- Style analysis preparation for Phase 3 integration
- Social media account linking and management

**Files Affected:**
- `agents/avatar/avatar_personality.py` - Enhance for style adaptation
- `agents/avatar/avatar_content_generator.py` - Add multi-modal generation
- `management/` - Add social media account management

#### Phase 3 Complete Redesign (REPLACED)
**Original Plan:** Video Production Pipeline
- Video production agent for end-to-end creation
- Script generation system
- External video processing tool integration
- Automated video workflow with n8n

**New Plan:** Influencer Content Pipeline
- Influencer harvesting agent with WebSurfer
- Style analysis agent with AI-powered pattern recognition
- Content generation agent with style matching
- Social media publishing agent with multi-platform distribution

**New File Structure:**
```
agents/content/
├── influencer_harvesting_agent.py
├── style_analysis_agent.py  
├── content_generation_agent.py
└── social_media_publishing_agent.py

├── content_adapters/
└── publishing_scheduler.py

tools/content/
├── media_downloader.py
├── style_extractor.py
├── brand_profiler.py
└── platform_optimizer.py
```

### Configuration Changes

#### New Configuration Files
- `config/social_media.yaml` - Platform API credentials and harvesting targets
- `config/influencer_targets.yaml` - Target influencer profiles and content types

#### Updated Configuration Files
- `config/config2.yaml` - Added WebSurfer, AI generation tools (DALL-E, RunwayML, ElevenLabs)

### Integration Changes

#### New Integration Points
- **Social Media Platform APIs**: TikTok Research API, Instagram Graph API, YouTube Data API, Twitter API v2
- **AI Generation Tools**: DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, RunwayML, ElevenLabs, Murf
- **Content Analysis Tools**: OpenCV, Google Vision API, custom CNN models, spaCy, NLTK

#### Enhanced Integration Points
- **WebSurfer**: Upgraded from basic web crawling to sophisticated social media scraping
- **Avatar APIs**: Enhanced with style-aware emotion mapping and multi-modal output
- **n8n Workflows**: Extended to support social media publishing and content coordination

### Timeline Impact
- **Phase 1 Timeline**: Extended by 1-2 weeks for WebSurfer and social media API integration
- **Phase 2 Timeline**: Maintained, but scope enhanced with style-aware avatar capabilities  
- **Phase 3 Timeline**: Completely restructured, complexity increased but more focused scope

### Success Criteria Changes
- **NEW**: Successfully harvest and catalog influencer content from multiple platforms
- **NEW**: Extract and model influencer style patterns with >80% consistency recognition
- **NEW**: Generate content matching influencer style with >85% brand consistency score
- **NEW**: Achieve automated multi-platform publishing with optimal engagement timing
- **ENHANCED**: Avatar responses must adapt personality to match analyzed influencer styles

### Rollback Plan
If reversal is needed:
1. Revert to git tag: `req-v2.0-original-content-factory` 
2. Restore archived plans from `/docs/archived_plans/phase3_original_video_production.md`
3. Remove social media API integrations and WebSurfer enhancements
4. Return to basic video production pipeline approach

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Multi-platform API rate limits and access restrictions
- **Legal Risk**: Content harvesting compliance with platform terms of service
- **Complexity Risk**: Increased system complexity with multiple AI tool integrations
- **Mitigation**: Phased implementation with fallback to basic content generation
